**02.	PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

 The old manual system was suffering from a series of drawbacks. Since whole of the system was to be maintained with hands the process of keeping, maintaining and retrieving the information was very tedious and lengthy. The records were never used to be in a systematic order. There used to be lots of difficulties in associating any particular transaction with a particular context. There would always be unnecessary consumption of time while entering records and retrieving records. One more problem was that it was very difficult to find errors while entering the records. Once the records were entered it was very difficult to update these records. 
The reason behind it is that there is lot of information to be maintained and have to be kept in mind while running the business. For this reasons we have provided features Present system is partially automated, actually existing system is quite laborious as one has to enter same information at three different places. 
 
**03.	EXISTING SYSTEM:** 
Existing system is manual system. It requires lots of file work to be done. It is a time consuming system. All user information is maintained manually. Any searching requires so much effort manually. There is no way of spreading the information so fast and in cheapest manner in previous system all information does not get into one place, here people can write whatever they want to write. 
 
    3.1 DRAWBACKS OF EXISTING SYSTEM: 
    
    1)	Data redundancy and formatting – the various files are likely to have different formats and therefore lead to redundancy and inconsistency. 
    
    2)	Maintaining registers is costly – traditionally documents have been stored in batches and they filed in file cabinets and boxes. A numerical system is assigned specifically a user number assigned to organize the files. 
    
    3)	Error prone – existing system are error prone, since manual work is required. More time is consumed and errors may propagate due to human mistakes. 
    
    4)	Low security feature – due to maintenance of record manually and shared and could view easily by anyone also these could be possible loss of data and confidential information due to some disaster in form of fire, theft etc. 


    3.2 BENEFITS OF PROJECT: 
  
    •	Data can be saved safely 
    
    •	No other person can view other persons detail 
    
    •	Greater efficiency 
    
    •	User friendliness 
    
    •	Minimum time required 
    
    •	Free of cost 



**04.	PROPOSED MODEL:** 

In this phase, a logical system is built which fulfills the given requirements. Design phase of software development deals with transforming the client’s requirements into a logically working system. Normally, design is performed in the following in the following two steps: 
 
  4.1	Primary Design Phase: 
  
      In this phase, the system is designed at block level. The blocks are created on the basis of analysis done in the problem identification phase. Different blocks are created for different functions emphasis is put on minimizing the information flow between blocks. 
Thus, all activities which require more interaction are kept in one block. 
 
 
    4.2	Secondary Design Phase: 
      
      In the secondary phase the detailed design of every block is performed. 
 
    4.3	The general tasks involved in the design process are the following: 
    
    •	Design various blocks for overall system processes. 
    
    •	Design smaller, compact and workable modules in each block. 
    
    •	Design various database structures. 
    
    •	Specify details of programs to achieve desired functionality. 
    
    •	Design the form of inputs, and outputs of the system. 
    
    •	Perform documentation of the design.  
    
    •	System reviews. 

 
**05.	IMPLEMENTATION:**

  5.1 User Interface Design: 
  User Interface Design is concerned with the dialogue between a user and the computer. It is concerned with everything from starting the system of logging into the system to the eventually presentation of desired inputs and outputs. The overall flow of screens and messages is called a dialogue. 
   
    5.1.1 The following steps are various guidelines for User Interface Design: 
    
  •	The system user should always be aware of what to do next. 
  
  •	The screen should be formatted so that various types of information, instructions and messages always appear in the same general display area. 
  
  •	Message, instructions or information should be displayed long enough to allow the system user to read them. 
  
  •	Use display attributes sparingly. 
  
  •	Default values for fields and answered to be entered by the user should be specified. 
  
  •	A use should not be allowed to proceed without correcting an error. 
  
  •	The system user should never get an operating system message or fatal error. 
   
  5.1.2 Setup of virtual environment: 

  A virtual environment is a self-contained directory tree that contains dependencies required by different projects isolated to existing packages.By using virtual nodeJS environments, applications can run in VS Coder in isolation of other applications 

**6.	CONCLUSION:**

While developing a system a conscious effort has been made to create and develop a software package, making use of available tools, techniques and resources – that will generate the proper system cases. 
While making the system an eye has been kept on making it as user friendly as such one may hope that the system will be acceptable to any user and will adequetly meet his/her needs. As in case of any system development process where are number of short comings, there have been some short comings in the development of this system also. 
 
**7.	FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS :**

1)	Adding pagination to the index page. 
2)	We can integrate the postgre SQL with Django. 
3)	Configuring of static assets can be done. 
4)	Integration of summer note WYSIWYG editor can be done. 
5)	Sitemap can be created.
